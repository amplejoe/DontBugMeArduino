    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>
    This game is the result of the <a target="_blank" href="http://itec.aau.at/gamejam/">2nd Klagenfurt Game Jam 2015 </a>
    (<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/klujam?src=hash/">#klujam</a>). It's a 1 Keyboard Multiplayer
    Game that features energetic bugs, that race each other on a single screen. The Bugs are named and modelled after
    Austrian skiing athletes - Andi Goldi, Marcel Hirschi, Raini Schöni & Marlies Schildi. They are controlled by up to
    4 players with a single key for each. These keys are randomized constantly so the players have to be quick
    to find their currently assigned one on the keyboard - Don't bug your opponents!
    Pressing the right keys gives the bugs an energy boost, failing to do so results in the bug falling
    behind and eventually below the screen, which means the game is lost for that player. The last
    bug on the screen wins.
    </p>

    <h1>Controls</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>
            ENTER/SPACEBAR advances between title & menu screens.
        </li>
        <li>
            Use 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' to control your bug.
        </li>
        <li>
            Before the race starts (after go) all players MUST press their corresponding keys simultaneously.
        </li>
        <li>
            On GameOver Screen a new game can be started with ENTER/SPACEBAR as well.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Technology</h1>
    <p>
    The Game was written in <a target="_blank" href="https://phaser.io/">Phaser</a>, a HTML 5 media framework based on JavaScript.
    IDEAs <a target="_blank" href="https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/">WebStorm</a> was used as an IDE and all Classes were written in
    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a>, which is a free open source programming language developed
    and maintained by Microsoft. Typescript is a superset of JavaScript and aims at making JavaScript programming
    more object-oriented.
    </p>

    <h1>Known Issues</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Before the race sometimes not all keys pressed are recognized simultaneously (only individually).
            This is due to the fact that apparently, as pointed out in the
            <a target="_blank" href="http://phaser.io/docs/Phaser.Keyboard.html/Phaser.Keyboard.html">
            Phaser documentation</a>, many keyboards are unable to process certain combinations of keys
            due to hardware limitations known as ghosting.
            Please restart the game in this case (Refresh Browser with F5).
        </li>
        <li>
            Firefox and Opera encounter sound problems.
        </li>
    </ul>
